## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [Y] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [Y] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [Y] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [Y] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [Y] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [Y] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [Y] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [Y] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [Y] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [Y] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [Y] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [Y] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [Y] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [Y] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [N] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [N] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

**2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)** 

When creating this submission, I first had to get over how daunting the pre-work seemed at a quick glance. I had never used html, css, nor javascript and always thought they were difficult languages. Once I actually started on the pre-work, I saw that the tasks were very beginner friendly. Seeing the website go from nothing to a fully functional game was really cool. I have always wanted to learn how to create a website, and the pre-work assignment gave me a taste of what that’s like. Moving on from the initial requirements, I struggled with adding some of the optional features. Specifically speeding up the game and adding images to the buttons. Since I was completely new to the programming languages in the assignment, I had to think carefully about how they worked. I did this by looking back at the code that was already written and using similar functions or lines of code. I also found my background in java to be helpful since a few functions like the if statements, for loops, and object ownership were similar. In the end, I managed to figure out how to speed up the game. I added images to the buttons, but I could not figure out how to hide them until a user clicks on them. I believe that is something that would have to be implemented in the css file, using the ‘display: none’ function. 

**3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)**

While creating the game, I realized there were a lot of components and a lot of things to consider when adding functionality. This makes me wonder how complex websites work. Websites with multiple pages, those that intake user information, those that have moving graphics, and those that take payments. I would assume implementing these features would take quite a while to do and would probably be done using a team of engineers. It also interests me to see how building a website would function within a team. How the work would be split, how the roles of each are assigned, and how collaborative the process is. I would also be interested in seeing how the process of creating a website for a client would be like. Everything would have to be tailored to their needs and get regularly checked to make sure it meets their expectations. One aspect that I am not quite sure of is how databases fit into web development and how they work. I have a general idea of what they are used for, but I am not sure what implementing one would be like. Finally, I am interested in seeing the process of creating a website from scratch up until its publication. To be clear, I mean a site that is not created through a tool like Glitch. Eventually, I would like to create my own website to display my projects. It also is a goal of mine to create a website for a small business, so this topic heavily intrigues me.

**4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)**

If I had a few more hours, I would change a few features and add additional features. I would hide the images on the buttons until a user clicks on them. I would also add different audio to each button, perhaps have each button have their own song or something similar. I think it would be interesting to make the buttons swap around after the clue sequence is played. For example, if the buttons from left to right are blue, red, yellow, and orange, they could swap to yellow, blue, orange, and red. This would add another layer of difficulty to the game and would challenge the players. To add even more difficulty, random flash rounds could be added where the speed of the clue sequence or the button swap is much faster. To make the game more competitive, I think player scores could be implemented, where points are deducted for mistakes, points are awarded for the repeating the correct pattern, and points are awarded for how fast the player repeats the pattern. Another feature I think would be interesting is retaining player scores with a scoreboard so everyone can see the top five scores of all time. However, I think that feature would be difficult to implement and I most likely would not be able to do it by myself. It would be fun to try and see where it leads me, though.
